This repository includes some rough mockup code for profile-editing.

Instructions:
 * Install CiviCRM (Note: only tested with trunk) (e.g. to "/var/www/sites/all/modules/civicrm")
 * Setup a local extension directory. You can simply make a subdir under the civicrm root (e.g. "mkdir /var/www/sites/all/modules/civicrm/ext") or you can configure a custom directory in the traditional way.
 * Clone the org.civicrm.profilemockup git repository (e.g. "cd /var/www/sites/all/modules/civicrm/ext; git clone git://github.com/totten/org.civicrm.profilemockup.git")
 * Navigate to "Manage Extensions". Click "Refresh" and install "org.civicrm.profilemockup")
 * Navigate to "/civicrm/profile-editor"
